In September this year, Gusto launched a new product called Gusto Wallet and Just Most HR software offers payroll services, and Gusto is no different. What does make it stand out is the unlimited payroll option. Under the Gusto Wallet product is the "Cashout" option which allows Gusto costumers to pay employees any time they want for no additional fees. No need to wait until the scheduled payment cycle arrives. Gusto payroll lets you make off-cycle payments, award bonuses, and factor in one-time workers without a hassle. Cancelling payments is also easier with Gusto than most other sites.

## Landscape:

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
Based on a survey of online reviews, Gusto is on top of its game mainly due to the ease of use of its technology and outstanding customer service.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer?
I would suggest the company to offer personal loans (e.g. Housing loans, car loans, cash loans) to be packaged as actual benefits from the employers.  
* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company? 
The employees of Gusto's clients are a captured market.  Gusto can earn a commission for every loan that is successfully taken out.  

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize? 
Gusto can do this by partnering with these FinTech companies: (1) Cross River Bank, another FinTech company which has disrupted the Lending Space. Cross River Bank was a former community bank that now dominates the online lending industry; or (2) Avant, another online lending company which makes instant online of $2,000 to $35,000 to average Joes. If Gusto would like to underwrite the loan packages themselves, they may license the automated credit decision technology developed by Kabbage. As an example, Kabbage has licensed its technology to big banks such as ING and Santander.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
These technologies are like turnkey projects which Gusto can implement without the need for extensive R&D or capital (hiring of knowledgable staff; physical infrastructure) thus are appropriate for my suggested additional loan (aka benefits package) product.
